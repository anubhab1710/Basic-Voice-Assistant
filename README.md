# Simple Voice Assistant using `speech_recognition` Module

Implemented a basic voice assistant with Command Line output that can perform the following function:
- Tell the Time
- Search for a term on Google by opening the default browser
- Search a location on Google Maps

The assistant can record and recognize audio information from microphone input (requires `PyAudio` module) and transcribes the audio to implement the programmed functions on the given input.
